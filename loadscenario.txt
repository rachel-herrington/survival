[SCENARIO] DESPAIR
[DESCRIPTION] Frost has covered the wrought iron bars of your cell.  It’s dark but you can just make out haphazardly stacked supply boxes on the other side of the room. The grimy wooden walls of the brig creak and strain under the burden of the crushing ice.  The lock on your cell was broken on an earlier voyage and never repaired but it doesn’t matter because you are chained by the ankle to a metal ring on the floor.  The keys to your chains are hanging by door, out of reach.
Inspect Environment
It’s hopeless, sit down and give up
Pull on the chain
Shout for help
[INSPECT ENVIRONMENT]  The only items in your cell are a small metal cup and the old worn blanket you’ve wrapped yourself in.  The floor is slick with accumulating ice.
[YOU SUCCEED]  Despair overwhelms you.  Sitting on the cold floor of your cell, all you can think about is home and your inevitable fate.  In a fit of anger and frustration you throw your cup.  It bounces through the bars of your cell, hitting the precariously stacked boxes on the other side of the room.  They topple to the ground.
[YOU FAIL]  You’ve tried this before but can’t see any other way to escape.  You stand up and grab the chain with both hands, leaning back, you pull as hard as you can.  The floor is covered in ice and you lose your balance, landing with a sickening crack, you realize that the fall has broken your wrist.
[DEATH OCCURS] You shout for hours to no avail.  Darkness falls and you can no longer see anything around you.  The walls in the brig crack explosively, finally giving in to the ice.  You feel the freezing seawater rushing in...all hope is lost.
